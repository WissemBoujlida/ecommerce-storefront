# Ecommerce Storefront

Before starting my own projects, I wanted to see how experienced devs build web applications using modern technologies. So here I'm trying to follow this great [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5miHyP6lExg) building an ecommerce platform.\

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
